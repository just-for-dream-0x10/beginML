# PyTorch Computer Vision Notes

This directory contains comprehensive notes and examples for computer vision using PyTorch. It covers both fundamental concepts and advanced topics in computer vision.

## Contents

- [Image Processing Basics](image_processing.md)
- [Convolutional Neural Networks](conv_nets.md)
- [Object Detection](object_detection.md)
- [Image Segmentation](image_segmentation.md)
- [Generative Models](generative_models.md)
- [Transfer Learning](transfer_learning.md)
- [Data Augmentation](data_augmentation.md)
- [Best Practices](best_practices.md)

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of PyTorch tensors and neural networks
- Familiarity with computer vision concepts
- Recommended packages:
  - `torchvision`
  - `torchvision.transforms`
  - `torchvision.models`
  - `PIL` (Python Imaging Library)
  - `opencv-python`
  - `albumentations` (for advanced augmentations)

## Getting Started

To run the examples, make sure you have the required dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Each topic includes both theoretical explanations and practical code examples. The examples are designed to be self-contained and can be run independently.
